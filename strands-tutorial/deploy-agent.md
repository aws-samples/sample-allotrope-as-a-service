# Deploying Strands AI Agents to [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)


AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with Amazon ECS and EKS. It allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. This makes it an excellent choice for deploying Strands agents as containerized applications with high availability and scalability.

## Prerequisites 

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
- Python 3.12 or later
- Either:
  - [Podman](https://podman.io/) installed and running
  - (or) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
  - Ensure podman or docker daemon is running.

- Step 1: Setup
- Step 2: Create restaurant agent
- Step 3: Define CDK stack and deploy infrastructure
- Step 4: Invoke the deployed agent

## Step 1: Setup


```python
!npm install
```


```python
!pip install -r ./docker/requirements.txt
```


```python
!pip install -r agent-requirements.txt
```


```python
!npx cdk bootstrap
```

## Step 2: Create restaurant agent

This is a TypeScript-based CDK (Cloud Development Kit) example that demonstrates how to deploy a Strands Agents to AWS Fargate. The example deploys a restaurant agent that runs as a containerized service in AWS Fargate with an Application Load Balancer. The application is built with FastAPI and provides two endpoints:

1. `/invoke` - A standard endpoint
2. `/invoke-streaming` - A streaming endpoint that delivers information in real-time as it's being generated

</p>

Let's now deploy the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base and the DynamoDB used in this solution. After it is deployed, we will save the Knowledge Base ID and DynamoDB table name as parameters in [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html). You can see the code for it in the `prereqs` folder


```python
!sh deploy_prereqs.sh
```


```python
import boto3
import uuid
```


```python
kb_name = 'restaurant-assistant'
dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
smm_client = boto3.client('ssm')
table_name = smm_client.get_parameter(
    Name=f'{kb_name}-table-name',
    WithDecryption=False
)
table = dynamodb.Table(table_name["Parameter"]["Value"])
kb_id = smm_client.get_parameter(
    Name=f'{kb_name}-kb-id',
    WithDecryption=False
)

# Get current AWS session
session = boto3.session.Session()

# Get region
region = session.region_name

# Get account ID using STS
sts_client = session.client("sts")
account_id = sts_client.get_caller_identity()["Account"]

print("DynamoDB table:", table_name["Parameter"]["Value"])
print("Knowledge Base Id:", kb_id["Parameter"]["Value"])
```

### Define tools

Lets first start by defining tools


```python
%%writefile docker/app/get_booking.py
from strands import tool

## Step 3: Define CDK stack and deploy infrastructure

## 🧠 Overview: What This Stack Does

This AWS CDK stack sets up a **highly available, secure, and scalable cloud infrastructure** to run a containerized application that interacts with **Bedrock**, **DynamoDB**, and a **knowledge base**. It automatically builds and deploys the service using AWS Fargate (a serverless container platform) and exposes it through a load-balanced endpoint.

---

## 🔧 Resources Created and Why They Matter

### 🛡️ Secure Data Storage (S3 Buckets)

* **Agent Bucket**: Stores internal agent-related data securely. We use this bucket to store agent session data. 
* **Access Log Bucket**: Collects logs about access to other buckets for auditing and compliance.
* **Flow Log Bucket**: Stores logs of network traffic within the system for monitoring and troubleshooting.

All buckets are encrypted, versioned, and block public access.

---

### 🌐 Networking (VPC and Flow Logs)

* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Isolates network traffic to protect your service. It spans **2 Availability Zones** for higher uptime.
* **Flow Logs**: Captures all traffic within the VPC and sends it to the Flow Log Bucket, helping with network monitoring and security analysis.
* **NAT Gateway**: Allows private resources to securely access the internet.

---

### 🧩 Compute Platform (ECS Fargate + Cluster)

* **ECS Cluster**: Hosts the containerized application.
* **Fargate Tasks**: These are the compute units that run your Docker container without you needing to manage servers.

  * **Auto-scaled to run 2 copies** of the application for reliability.
  * Deployed in **private subnets**, not directly exposed to the internet.

---

### 🚢 Container Setup

* **Docker Image**: Built from a Dockerfile located in your project repo (`../../docker`).
* **ARM64 Linux Platform**: Ensures cost-effective and energy-efficient execution.
* **Environment Variables**: Includes configuration like logging level and knowledge base ID.
* **Logging**: Logs from the application go to a **dedicated CloudWatch Log Group**, retained for 1 week.

---

### 🔐 IAM Roles & Permissions

* **Task Execution Role**: Allows the service to pull container images and write logs.
* **Task Role**: Grants fine-grained access to:

  * **Bedrock API** (to invoke models and retrieve knowledge base content)
  * **DynamoDB** (to read/write agent data)
  * **SSM Parameter Store** (to retrieve config values)
* **Flow Log Role**: Allows VPC to write network logs to S3.

---

### 🌍 Load Balancer (Application Load Balancer)

* **Publicly accessible** and routes internet traffic to your private containers.
* **Health checks** ensure only healthy containers receive traffic.
* **Highly available**: spreads across multiple Availability Zones.
* **Optional access logs** can be enabled for debugging or analytics.

---

### 📄 Configuration Parameters

* **SSM Parameters**: Securely retrieves the names/IDs of:

  * The **knowledge base**
  * The **DynamoDB table**
* These parameters can be managed outside of the code and updated easily.

---

### 📈 Monitoring & Best Practices

* Uses **VPC Flow Logs** for network visibility.
* Includes **Nag suppressions** to acknowledge and justify intentional configurations (e.g., public access for ALB, IAM permissions).
* **Logging and versioning** are enabled for better traceability and rollback.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### 🔓 Public Access to the Load Balancer

The **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** created by this stack is **publicly accessible** over the internet. This means:

* **Anyone with the ALB DNS name can send requests** to your service (assuming security group and app-level controls allow it).
* While this is necessary for public-facing applications, it can pose a **security risk** if not properly protected.

> ✅ **Recommendation**: Ensure your application has proper authentication and request validation in place. If the service is meant for internal use only, consider replacing the public ALB with a private one.

---

### 📉 Access Logging Disabled on ALB

The ALB **does not have access logs enabled**. Access logs are useful for:

* Troubleshooting and debugging
* Security auditing
* Analytics and traffic insight

> ⚠️ **Consequence**: You will not have visibility into incoming HTTP requests unless application-level logging is implemented.

> ✅ **Recommendation**: Consider enabling ALB access logs and writing them to a dedicated S3 bucket for future observability and compliance.

<p style="color:red;"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are running this notebook in local environment make sure to provide `--context envName=local`.</p>



```python
## Local Environment (un-comment this)
# !npx cdk deploy --require-approval never --context envName=local

## Sagemaker Environment 
!npx cdk deploy --require-approval never
```

## Step 4: Invoke the deployed agent


```python
import subprocess
import requests

# Step 1: Get the service URL from CDK output using AWS CLI
result = subprocess.run(
    [
        "aws", "cloudformation", "describe-stacks",
        "--stack-name", "StrandsAgentFargateStack",
        "--query", "Stacks[0].Outputs[?ExportName=='StrandsAgent-service-endpoint'].OutputValue",
        "--output", "text"
    ],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True
)


SERVICE_URL = result.stdout.strip()
print(f"Service URL: {SERVICE_URL}")
```


```python
session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
```


```python
 # Step 2: Make the POST request to the Fargate service

response = requests.post(
    f"http://{SERVICE_URL}/invoke/{session_id}",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"prompt": "Hi, where can I eat in San Francisco?"}
)

# Print response
print("Response:", response.text)
```


```python
 # Step 3: Make the POST request to the streaming endpoint
response = requests.post(
    f"http://{SERVICE_URL}/invoke/{session_id}",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"prompt": "Make a reservation for tonight at Rice & Spice."},
)

print("Response:", response.text)
```


```python
 # Step 4: Continue conversation
response = requests.post(
    f"http://{SERVICE_URL}/invoke/{session_id}",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"prompt": "At 8pm, for 4 people in the name of Anna"},
    timeout=120,
)

print("Response:", response.text)
```


```python
# Step 5: Streaming response
session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

response = requests.post(
    f"http://{SERVICE_URL}/invoke-streaming/{session_id}",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"prompt": "Hi, where can I eat in San Francisco?"},
    timeout=120,
    stream=True  # Important for streaming
)

print("Streaming response:")
for line in response.iter_lines():
    if line:
        print(line.decode('utf-8'))
```

### Validating that the action was performed correctly
Let's now check that our tool worked and that the Amazon DynamoDB was updated as it should.


```python
import pandas as pd

def selectAllFromDynamodb(table_name):
    # Get the table object
    table = dynamodb.Table(table_name)

    # Scan the table and get all items
    response = table.scan()
    items = response["Items"]

    # Handle pagination if necessary
    while "LastEvaluatedKey" in response:
        response = table.scan(ExclusiveStartKey=response["LastEvaluatedKey"])
        items.extend(response["Items"])

    items = pd.DataFrame(items)
    return items


# test function invocation
items = selectAllFromDynamodb(table_name["Parameter"]["Value"])
print(items)
```
